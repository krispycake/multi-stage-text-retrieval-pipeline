The goal of this assignment is to implement a multi-stage text retrieval pipeline for question-answering tasks, incorporating both embedding models and ranking models. 
Benchmark different ranking models to assess their impact on retrieval accuracy and understand trade-offs related to model size, accuracy, and performance.

Contains 2 notebooks for comparison: 1. without ranking models 2. with ranking models
